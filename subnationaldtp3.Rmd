title: "Subnational DTP3 Coverage"

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This visualization shows the 2016 Coverage rate and number of surviving infants at the subnational level across the world. I was struck by the aesthetics of the plot, however I am torn as to whether the redundant encoding of size and color is distracting or not. I have been taught that all redundant information should be excluded, and quite clearly each variable is encoded in two different aesthetics, however I do think the colors, at least, help to differentiate and draw the eye. Regardless, the plot was quite a challenge to replicate so I kept the redundancy just for fun.

This is my version of the visualization. The code is included below.
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("replications/subnat.png")
```

This is the original visualization (available [here](http://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/who-immuniz.pdf?ua=1)).
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("originals/subnat.png")
```

All the code for the visualization is below
